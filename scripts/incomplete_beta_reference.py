"""High-precision references for `regularized_incomplete_beta` and
`student_t_quantile`, written to tests/data/.

incomplete_beta.txt: `x a b I` per line, I_x(a, b) from mpmath's betainc at 50
digits, printed to 30. The shapes are every pair from
{1e-3, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 10, 100, 1e3, 1e4}; for each pair x is taken at the
mean, at 1, 3, 10 and 40 standard deviations either side, just either side of
the continued fraction's switch (a+1)/(a+b+2), at 1/2, and at four uniform
draws (seed 20260917). Points outside (0, 1) are dropped, and a case mpmath has not finished within
20 seconds is left out and named on stderr. Shapes beyond 1e4
are out of mpmath's practical reach (some take hours); the Rust tests check them by exact
identities and symmetry instead.

student_t.txt: `freedom probability t` per line, the one-sided Student t
quantile from mpmath at 50 digits by solving I_{nu/(nu+t^2)}(nu/2, 1/2) = 2(1-p)
for t by bisection. The grid is the regime of factoring's polynomial race: freedom
(arms - 1)(blocks - 1) for 2 to 32 arms and 2 to 64 blocks, and probability
1 - 0.05/(2 (field - 1) 16) for fields of 2 to 32, plus the two-sided
5%, 1% and 0.1% points at 1 to 30 and 60, 120 degrees of freedom.
